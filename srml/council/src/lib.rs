//! # Council Module
//!
//! The Council module provides tools to manage the council and proposals. The main components are:
//!
//! - **Council Seats:** Election of councillors.
//! 	- [`seats::Trait`](./seats/trait.Trait.html)
//! 	- [`Call`](./seats/enum.Call.html)
//! 	- [`Module`](./seats/struct.Module.html)
//! - **Council Motions:** Voting as a body to dispatch calls from the `Council` origin.
//! 	- [`motions::Trait`](./motions/trait.Trait.html)
//! 	- [`Call`](./motions/enum.Call.html)
//! 	- [`Module`](./motions/struct.Module.html)
//! - **Council Voting:** Proposals sent to the [Democracy module](../srml_democracy/index.html) for referenda.
//! 	- [`voting::Trait`](./voting/trait.Trait.html)
//! 	- [`Call`](./voting/enum.Call.html)
//! 	- [`Module`](./voting/struct.Module.html)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Council module provides functionality to handle:
//!
//! - Voting in and maintenance of council members.
//! - Proposing, vetoing, and passing of motions.
//!
//! The council is an on-chain entity comprised of a set of account IDs, with the role of representing
//! passive stakeholders. Its primary tasks are to propose sensible referenda and thwart any uncontroversially
//! dangerous or malicious referenda.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! #### Council Motions (motions.rs)
//!
//! _Motions_ handles internal proposals that are only proposed and voted upon by _councillors_.
//! Each proposal has a minimum threshold of yay votes that it needs to gain to be enacted.
//!
//! - **Council motion:** A mechanism used to enact a proposal.
//! - **Proposal:** A submission by a councillor. An initial vote of yay from that councillor is applied.
//! - **Vote:** A vote of yay or nay from a councillor on a single proposal. Councillors may change their vote but a
//!   duplicate vote will return an error.
//!
//! Upon each vote, if the threshold is reached, the proposal is dispatched from the `Council` origin. Similarly,
//! if the number of nay votes is high enough such that it could not pass even if all other councillors
//! (including those who have not voted) voted yay, the proposal is dropped.
//!
//! Note that a council motion has a special origin type, [`seats::Origin`](./motions/enum.Origin.html), that limits
//! which calls can be effectively dispatched.
//!
//! #### Council Voting (voting.rs)
//!
//! _Voting_ handles councillor proposing and voting. Unlike motions, if a proposal is approved,
//! it is elevated to the [Democracy module](../srml_democracy/index.html) as a referendum.
//!
//! - **Proposal validity:** A council proposal is valid when it's unique, hasn't yet been vetoed, and
//! when the proposing councillor's term doesn't expire before the block number when the proposal's voting period ends.
//! A proposal is a generic type that can be _dispatched_ (similar to variants of the `Call` enum in each module).
//! - **Proposal postponement:** Councillors may postpone a council proposal from being approved or rejected.
//! Postponement is equivalent to a veto, which only lasts for the cooloff period.
//! - **Cooloff period:** Period, in blocks, for which a veto is in effect.
//! - **Referendum:** The means of public voting on a proposal.
//! - **Veto:** A council member may veto any council proposal that exists. A vetoed proposal that's valid is set
//! aside for a cooloff period. The vetoer cannot re-veto or propose the proposal again until the veto expires.
//! - **Elevation:** A referendum can be elevated from the council to a referendum. This means it has
//! been passed to the Democracy module for a public vote.
//! - **Referendum cancellation:** At the end of a given block we cancel all elevated referenda whose voting period
//! ends at that block and where the outcome of the vote tally was a unanimous vote to cancel the referendum.
//! - **Voting process to elevate a proposal:** At the end of a given block we tally votes for expiring referenda.
//! Referenda that are passed (yay votes are greater than nay votes plus abstainers) are sent to the Democracy
//! module for a public referendum. If there are no nay votes (abstention is acceptable), then the proposal is
//! tabled immediately. Otherwise, there will be a delay period. If the vote is unanimous, then the public
//! referendum will require a vote threshold of supermajority against to prevent it. Otherwise,
//! it is a simple majority vote. See [`VoteThreshold`](../srml_democracy/enum.VoteThreshold.html) in the
//! Democracy module for more details on how votes are approved.
//!
//! As opposed to motions, proposals executed through the Democracy module have the
//! root origin, which gives them the highest privilege.
//!
//! #### Council Seats (seats.rs)
//!
//! _Seats_ handles the selection of councillors. The selection of council seats is a circulating procedure,
//! regularly performing approval voting to accept a new council member and remove those whose period has ended.
//! Each tally (round of voting) is divided into two time periods:
//!
//!   - **Voting period:** In which any stakeholder can vote for any of the council candidates.
//!   - **Presentation period:** In which voting is no longer allowed and stakeholders can _present_ a candidate
//!   and claim that a particular candidate has won a seat.
//!
//! A tally is scheduled to execute based on the number of desired and free seats in the council.
//!
//! Both operations have associated bonds and fees that need to be paid based on the complexity of the transaction.
//! See [`set_approvals`](./seats/enum.Call.html#variant.set_approvals) and
//! [`submit_candidacy`](./seats/enum.Call.html#variant.submit_candidacy) for more information.
//!
//! Upon the end of the presentation period, the leaderboard is finalized and sorted based on the approval
//! weight of the _presented_ candidates.
//! Based on the configurations of the module, `N` top candidates in the leaderboard are immediately recognized
//! as councillors (where `N` is `desired_seats - active_council.len()`) and runners-up are kept in
//! the leaderboard as carry for the next tally to compete again. Similarly, councillors whose term has ended
//! are also removed.
//!
//! - **Vote index**: A counter indicating the number of tally rounds already applied.
//! - **Desired seats:** The number of seats on the council.
//! - **Candidacy bond:** Bond required to be a candidate. The bond is returned to all candidates at the end
//! of the tally if they have won the tally (i.e. have become a councillor).
//! - **Leaderboard:** A list of candidates and their respective votes in an election, ordered low to high.
//! - **Presentation:** The act of proposing a candidate for insertion into the leaderboard. Presenting is
//! `O(|number_of_voters|)`, so the presenter must be slashable and will be slashed for duplicate or invalid
//! presentations. Presentation is only allowed during the "presentation period," after voting has closed.
//! - **Voting bond:** Bond required to be permitted to vote. Must be held because many voting operations affect
//! storage. The bond is held to disincent abuse.
//! - **Voting:** Process of inserting approval votes into storage. Can be called by anyone, given she submits
//! an appropriate list of approvals. A bond is reserved from a voter until she retracts or gets reported.
//! - **Inactive voter**: A voter whose approvals are now invalid. Such voters can be _reaped_ by other voters
//!   after an `inactivity_grace_period` has passed from their last known activity.
//! - **Reaping process:** Voters may propose the removal of inactive voters, as explained above. If the claim is not
//! valid, the _reaper_ will be slashed and removed as a voter. Otherwise, the _reported_ voter is removed. A voter
//! always gets his or her bond back upon being removed (either through _reaping_ or _retracting_).
//!
//! ### Goals
//!
//! The Council module in Substrate is designed to make the following possible:
//!
//! - Create council proposals by councillors using the council motion mechanism.
//! - Validate council proposals.
//! - Tally votes of council proposals by councillors during the proposal's voting period.
//! - Veto (postpone) council proposals for a cooloff period through abstention by councillors.
//! - Elevate council proposals to start a referendum.
//! - Execute referenda once their vote tally reaches the vote threshold level of approval.
//! - Manage candidacy, including voting, term expiration, and punishment.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! The dispatchable functions in the Council module provide the functionality that councillors need.
//! See the `Call` enums from the Motions, Seats, and Voting modules for details on dispatchable functions.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! The public functions provide the functionality for other modules to interact with the Council module.
//! See the `Module` structs from the Motions, Seats, and Voting modules for details on public functions.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Council Seats: Councillor Election Procedure
//!
//! A Council seat vote can proceed as follows:
//!
//! 1. Candidates submit themselves for candidacy.
//! 2. Voting occurs.
//! 3. Voting period ends and presentation period begins.
//! 4. Candidates are presented for the leaderboard.
//! 5. Presentation period ends, votes are tallied, and new council takes effect.
//! 6. Candidate list is cleared (except for a defined number of carries) and vote index increased.
//!
//! ### Council Votes: Proposal Elevation Procedure
//!
//! A council motion elevation would proceed as follows:
//!
//! 1. A councillor makes a proposal.
//! 2. Other councillors vote yay or nay or abstain.
//! 3. At the end of the voting period, the votes are tallied.
//! 4. If it has passed, then it will be sent to the Democracy module with the vote threshold parameter.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! This code snippet includes an `approve_all` public function that could be called to approve all
//! existing candidates, if a tally is scheduled to happen, without having to check the number of them.
//!
//! ```
//! use srml_support::{decl_module, dispatch::Result};
//! use system::ensure_signed;
//! use srml_council::seats;
//!
//! pub trait Trait: seats::Trait {}
//!
//! decl_module! {
//! 	pub struct Module<T: Trait> for enum Call where origin: T::Origin {
//!
//! 		pub fn approve_all(origin, vote_index: u32) -> Result {
//! 			// Get the appropriate block number to schedule the next tally.
//! 			let maybe_next_tally = <seats::Module<T>>::next_tally();
//!
//! 			if maybe_next_tally.is_some() {
//! 				// Create votes.
//! 				let candidate_count = <seats::Module<T>>::candidate_count();
//! 				let votes = vec![true; candidate_count as usize];
//!
//!					<seats::Module<T>>::set_approvals(origin, votes, vote_index)?;
//! 			}
//!
//!				// either way return `Ok`. You can change this and return an `Err` based on what you need.
//! 			Ok(())
//! 		}
//! 	}
//! }
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Genesis Config
//!
//! The Council module depends on the `GenesisConfig`.
//!
//! - [Seats](./seats/struct.GenesisConfig.html)
//! - [Voting](./voting/struct.GenesisConfig.html)
